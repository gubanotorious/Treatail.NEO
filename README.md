## This Repository
This repository contains the source code for the Treatail Smart Contract for the NEP5 Token (TTL) and Treatail Asset management, core middleware (leveraging [neo-lux](https://github.com/cityofzion/neo-lux)), REST API middleware, test libraries, and test harness.  It also contains a preliminary proof of concept Smart Contract that will be used by the product in the future to facilitate deal escrow payment distribution and supply chain workflows for deal fulfillment.

## The Product / dApp
### Overview
Treatail is a revolutionary commerce layer that sits on top of all the sites and marketplaces on the Internet.  Our platform allows for buyers, both consumer and business, to make offers and receive personalized deals on goods and services listed for sale on any site doing commerce on the Internet.  Our goal is to help buyers to get unpublished, personalized deals and help online retailers boost profits by optimizing inventory through precision discounts and reduced cart abandonment.

The cornerstone of the next evolution to the Treatail Ecosystem will be the creation of Treatail Token (TTL) and smart contracts to facilitate transactions on the blockchain and to further incent users.  To date, blockchain has primarily been available to technical users.  Treatail aims to change this by bringing the power of the NEO blockchain to the average user using intuitive interfaces and seamless integration into the Treatail platform.
