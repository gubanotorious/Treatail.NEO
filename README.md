## This Repository
This repository contains the source code for the Treatail Smart Contract for the NEP5 Token (TTL) and Treatail Asset management, Core middleware (leveraging [neo-lux](https://github.com/Relfos/neo-lux)), REST API, and tests libraries and harness for both middleware and API implementations.

## The Product / dApp
### Overview
Treatail is a revolutionary commerce layer that sits on top of all the sites and marketplaces on the Internet.  Our platform allows for buyers, both consumer and business, to make offers and receive personalized deals on goods and services listed for sale on any site doing commerce on the Internet.  Our goal is to help buyers to get unpublished, personalized deals and help online retailers boost profits by optimizing inventory through precision discounts and reduced cart abandonment.

The cornerstone of the next evolution to the Treatail Ecosystem will be the creation of Treatail Token (TTL) and smart contracts to facilitate transactions on the blockchain and to further incent users.  To date, blockchain has primarily been available to technical users.  Treatail aims to change this by bringing the power of the NEO blockchain to the average user using intuitive interfaces and seamless integration into the Treatail platform.

### Demo Site
There is a demo build of this code hosted at https://neo.treatail.com.              
_You must use this URL when signing up and logging in.  If you use the standard Treatail website signup and login, you will be in the production site without this code deployed and you will end up with the wrong extension build installed.  If this happens, just right click and uninstall the extension from chrome and go to the correct url._

Simply sign up for an account with your e-mail address to login as a buyer.  For the demo, the only store that offers can be made to is the "Treatail Demo Store".  We will respond to all offers as the seller, but if you need to gain access to the seller interface, please e-mail me or find me on the NEO Smart Economy Discord [@gubanotorious](https://discord.gg/zRq6Jba).

#### Buyer payment
This is the payment screen for the demo.  Treatail uses PayPal for all USD transactions, but this was unavailable in the demo site.  The demo site will only make the blockchain related TTL transfers at the close of a deal, but we skip over PayPal piece for brevity.

#### User details screen
This is the screen where the user can find their information - the links for them to share their referral link on social media, manage their TTL Token wallet and transfers, and see audit history of transfers of TTL.

</p>

#### Sending TTL Token to a Treatail user
Users can easily send TTL Tokens to other users in the Treatail ecosystem by providing just an e-mail address.  Treatail will find the hosted wallet information for that user and make the blockchain transfer on the behalf of the user.

#### Sending TTL Token to a NEO Address
Users can also send TTL Tokens to an external NEO Address, for example, if they want to use their own NEP5 compatible wallet to manage their own keys for the TTL they earn.  They can always transfer back to their Treatail address if needed.

## Credits
This project wouldn't have been possible without the education, hard work, and assistance from the [City of Zion](https://github.com/CityOfZion) NEO development community.  A big shout out to SÃ©rgio Flores ([Relfos](https://github.com/Relfos)) for his work on the debugger and neo-lux, and for all his assistance in getting neo-lux implemented in the project.  Thanks to Chris Hager ([metachris](https://github.com/metachris)) for his assistance in getting me started and rolling on neo-python and the basics of NEO development.
